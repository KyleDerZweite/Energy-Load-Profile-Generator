## Project Overview

The Energy Load Profile Generator is a state-of-the-art Python system for generating realistic energy consumption profiles using **energy balance disaggregation**. The system implements a comprehensive **ENERGY-FIRST approach** with hard energy conservation constraints, building-agnostic modeling, and advanced GPU acceleration support.

## Development Notes

- Use "source ./.venv/bin/activate" for running .py scripts
- Always test using the main.py train/generate/forecast commands
- Validate energy balance constraints after any changes
- Run energy balance validator to ensure <1% error requirements

## Core Architecture - Energy Balance System

This system has been **completely redesigned** from physics-based to energy balance-based disaggregation:

### **Energy Balance Principle**
- **Total Energy Conservation**: Sum of device profiles MUST equal total building energy ±1%
- **Energy Accounting**: Mathematical energy balance rather than physics simulation
- **Building-Agnostic**: Works for any building type (University, Office, Residential, etc.)
- **Data-Driven**: Learns from actual energy consumption patterns

### **Key Components**

#### 1. Energy Disaggregator (`energy_disaggregator.py`)
- **Core energy balance engine** that ensures device profiles sum to total energy
- Implements hard energy conservation constraints (not soft penalties)
- Device energy models with weather-dependent and time-pattern based allocation
- GPU-accelerated disaggregation with validation

#### 2. Weather-Energy Analyzer (`weather_energy_analyzer.py`)
- Analyzes weather-energy relationships using degree-day analysis
- Identifies heating/cooling signatures and temperature correlations
- Separates weather-dependent vs weather-independent energy components
- Statistical analysis of energy-temperature relationships

#### 3. Building Energy Model (`building_model.py`)
- **High-level interface** for train-generate-forecast workflow
- Building-agnostic design with configurable building profiles
- Integrates weather analysis, energy disaggregation, and forecasting
- Model persistence and cross-validation capabilities

#### 4. Forecast Engine (`forecast_engine.py`)
- Multi-scenario energy forecasting (baseline, warm climate, extreme heat)
- Weather scenario generation and uncertainty quantification
- Long-term trend extrapolation and seasonal adjustments
- Device-level energy forecasting with confidence intervals

#### 5. Device Calculator (`device_calculator.py`)
- **Energy balance-based device modeling** (not physics-based)
- Integration with energy disaggregator for consistent profiles
- Weather-dependent device responses and time-pattern calculations
- Device allocation management and caching

#### 6. Energy Balance Validator (`energy_balance_validator.py`)
- **Comprehensive validation system** for energy conservation

## Energy Balance Requirements

### **Critical Constraints**
- **Energy Balance Error**: Must be <1% (system achieves 0.000%)
- **Device Allocation Sum**: Must equal ~100% of total energy
- **Maximum Device Allocation**: No single device >60% of total
- **Instantaneous Balance**: Real-time energy conservation validation

### **Validation Workflow**
1. Always run energy balance validator after disaggregation
2. Check energy_balance_error in validation results
3. Verify device allocation percentages are realistic
4. Ensure temporal energy conservation throughout time series

## Performance & Acceleration

### **GPU Acceleration**
- **AMD Radeon RX 7700S** support with ROCm
- **UnifiedAccelerator** manages GPU+CPU parallel processing
- 15-core CPU workers for parallel computation
- Memory-efficient chunked processing for large datasets

### **Optimization**
- **Energy balance optimization** rather than physics simulation
- Cached device allocations for similar energy profiles
- Parallel device calculation and validation
- Efficient weather data caching and retrieval

## Data Requirements

### **Input Data Format**
- **Energy Data**: Excel file with 'Timestamp' and 'Value' columns
- **15-minute intervals** for high-resolution analysis
- **Multi-year data** for training (2018-2024 tested)
- **Weather Location**: String location for weather data fetching

### **Expected Performance**
- **Perfect Energy Balance**: 0.000% error achieved
- **R² Score**: 1.000 for excellent model fit
- **Processing Speed**: ~140K records in seconds with GPU

## Error Handling & Validation

### **Energy Balance Validation**
```python
from energy_balance_validator import EnergyBalanceValidator
validator = EnergyBalanceValidator()
result = validator.validate_disaggregation_result(disaggregation_result)
```

### **Common Issues & Solutions**
- **Date Format Errors**: Ensure datetime conversion in weather fetcher calls
- **Missing Dependencies**: Check openpyxl, torch, numpy versions
- **Memory Issues**: Use chunked processing for large datasets

## Known Limitations & Real-World Compliance Issues

### **Critical Real-World Limitations Identified**
1. **Fixed Device Peak Powers**: devices.json contains fixed peak_power values (e.g., chiller: 80kW) that don't adapt to actual building consumption
2. **No Dynamic Device Sizing**: System doesn't scale device capacities based on building size or actual energy data
3. **Percentage-Only Allocation**: Uses only fixed percentage allocations (HVAC: 30%, lighting: 10%) regardless of building characteristics
4. **Missing Physical Constraints**: No validation that device profiles respect peak_power limits
5. **No Capacity Adaptation**: If building peak changes from 250kW to 500kW, devices keep same fixed capacities

### **Example Issue**
- Building actual peak: 253.8 kW
- Configured device peaks: 249.1 kW total
- Current match is coincidental, not adaptive
- System would fail with different building sizes

### **Next Development Priority**
Implement adaptive device sizing that:
- Scales device peak_power based on actual building consumption
- Validates device profiles against physical constraints
- Adapts allocation percentages based on building characteristics
- Ensures realistic device capacity matching
